# Course-Management-System

The web application is built by Python & Django in the Backend part, while in the Frontend I used Bootstrap. The web application has four apps such as students, teachers, courses and users. Each app has a special way of structuring the data, in the student app we used function based-views while in other apps generic class based-views. The web application is based on a simple CRM for adding students in the form of a CRUD system, then adding courses and teachers. Each of them are separated in a separate session reached through the links in the sidebar menu. Also, the user must first register before being able to add students, courses and teachers. The use of this web application is intended to be only for the employees of a course company that holds different courses for students, so it is a web application that serves to manage students, teachers and the courses that this company offers.
